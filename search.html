	<h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">What is ClassBug?</h4>
    
    <div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
	ClassBug is user-friendly management software for class venues. It's the easiest way to manage your business and offer online registration and sales.  CB was built to accommodate the needs of the modern-day business manager: powerful enough to do everything you really need, but simple enough for anyone to learn.<br><br>

<div class="q-and-a">
    <h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">How does it work?</h4>
        
    <div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
        ClassBug works by first walking you through <a href="/registration_wizard" target="_blank">your business setup</a> (it's free, takes about 5 minutes).  <br><br>From there, easily add classes & events to your schedule, manage those classes, and track instructors & students. You can even sell your classes online, right away.
	</div>
</div>  
    
    
<div class="q-and-a">
    <h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">Do I first need to download the software?</h4>
        
    <div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
	Nope. Our software is web-based; you do everything right in your browser.  You can log in from anywhere, including via smartphones and tablets with internet.  Also, the
        software updates itself automatically, so you never have to worry about having the most recent version.
	</div>
</div>  
    
    
<div class="q-and-a">
    <h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">Is there a free trial?</h4>
        
    <div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
        Yes, you can use ClassBug free for a month. Fully featured.
	</div>
</div>  
    
    
<div class="q-and-a">
    <h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">Is there a contract required?</h4>
        
    <div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
	There are no contracts.  All ClassBug accounts operate month-to-month.  You can cancel anytime without penalty.<br>  
        You will need to agree to our <a href="/tos" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> in order to create an account.</div>

<div class="q-and-a">
    <h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">How do I get started setting up my business?</h4>
        
    <div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
        Click <a href="/registration_wizard" target="_blank">HERE</a> or on one of the green buttons at ClassBug.com.  We’ll walk you through the setup with some basic questions.  You create a login at the end, and we generate your Business Profile.  Takes about 5 minutes total.</div>
</div>  
    
    
<div class="q-and-a">
    <h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">Ok, I set up my business in 5 minutes.  How can I add classes to my schedule?</h4>
        
    <div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
        There are 2 ways.  1) From your Dashboard click "New Class/Event" button under Classes section, or 2) Go to your Schedule tab and click the "Add Class/Event" button.
    </div>
</div> 
 
<div class="q-and-a">
	<h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">
        Can I add <span class="users">additional users</span>?
	</h4>
	<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
	  Yes. Your ClassBug account includes 3 available logins for business-users. You can give these logins to anyone in your business that might need access to Classbug – owners, managers, receptionists, instructors – and all 3 users can be logged-in at the same time with no problems.  
	  <br><br>If you need more than 3 logins, you can add additional ones for $5/month per user.  Just go to your “Dashboard” and under “License” click “Manage.”<br><br>
          If you require more than 10 logins, please contact us at support@classbug.com for a volume discount.</div>
</div>  

<div class="q-and-a">
    <h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">Can’t we all just share one login?</h4>

    <div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
      You can, but there are limitations in doing so.  
      <br><br>For instance, multiple people cannot be logged in with the same username/password at the same time.  So if you’re trying to check CB from home, and someone else is checking at the office, one of you will be automatically signed out.  
      <br><br>Also, using one login doesn’t distinguish which person is adding notes & comments to the site, or making other important changes.
          <br><br>Most importantly, however, is that there are different levels of access depending on what type of login you create.  There are 3 types of logins: admins, non-admins, and instructors. All 3 come with diminishing levels of access to the software. </div>

		<h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">Can I sell a tuition-based series of classes?</h4>
        
		<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
		Yes.  From the "Setup Sales" page, check the box for "As an Entire Series" to reveal the proper form.<br><br>
            For more details on whether this is the correct option for your class, hover your cursor over the <img alt="Question_mark" src="/assets/question_mark-87eb74b56c2a60b4df47d0a074ba0b7e.gif" /> next to the option.

		You can create a new pack here, or simply associate your class with an existing pack.  EG, if you have a pack called "Fitness 10 class Punch Card" that can be redeemed for different classes, you only need to create that pack once -- after it exists in the software, it just needs to be associated with the other applicable classes.

		<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
		If you're selling your classes online with CB, your customers will register themselves.<br>
		Visitors to your CB web store are prompted to fill out a "Head of Family" registration form once they try to add a class or item to their cart. ClassBug requires basic registration info like name, email, phone, address, emergency contact, but you can create <a href="#customFieldsFAQ">custom fields</a> for this form as well.<br>
		The customer will also be prompted to enter student info as part of this process.  The student form can also be customized to your liking.
		<br><br>
            You can also register folks in-person through the <a href="#posFAQ">POS feature</a>.  There, you can create a new customer (aka Head of Family) or access an existing one.  Once you add a class to their "cart", you wil be prompted to select an existing student in that family or create a new one.</div>	
</div>
    
<div class="q-and-a">		
		<h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">Will my customers be creating a login during the online registration process?</h4>
        
		<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
		Yes, and this is quite useful for both the business and customer:
		<ul style="list-style: disc">
			<li>Customers can now login anytime to see things like purchase history, scheduled payments, upcoming classes</li>
			<li>Customers can update their own contact info and credit cards</li>
			<li>Customers can skip the registration forms next time they sign up</li>
			<li>Customers can check-in to some classes by redeeming stored class credits (if applicable)</li>
			<li>Business can cease fielding calls/emails related to scheduling or payment questions -- just have customers check for themselves.</li>

<div class="q-and-a">		
		<h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">How do I register people and sell items at my business?</h4>
    
		<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">In your POS tab, you have 2 options for registering and selling to a customer:
		  <ul>
		  	<li><b>1) Register a student whose Head of Family account already exists:</b>
		  		In the "Existing Customer" box, just start typing the family head's name (parent or primary purchaser typically) to select that account for a new transaction.
		   </li><br>
		  	<li><b>2) Register a student who does not yet have a Head of Family account in the software:</b>
		  		Click the "New Customer" button to fill out the Head of Family registration form. You'll then be redirected to the POS New Transaction window to choose classes and items. 
		  	</li>
		  </ul>
		</div>

<div class="q-and-a">		
		<h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">We have lots of adult students. Why do they need a Head of Family profile?</h4>
        
		<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
            For flexibility. The software is designed to handle all types of students & customers -- adults, kids, couples, large families, small families, individuals, etc -- and the cleanest way to organize everyone is by family, even if some "families" only have one person (most typical with adult students).
		</div>

		<h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">How do I choose which student in a family gets enrolled in a class?</h4>
        
		<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
            When you add a class to the customer's cart, the software will prompt you to choose a student from that family. If the studentdoesn't yet exist, you can create them right there.</div>

<div class="q-and-a">		
		<h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">Is there a quick way to find the right classes/items in POS?</h4>
        
		<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
            Yes. The search bar above the offerings list is very powerful.  Just start typing the name of a class/item and the list will be filtered for you.</div>

<div class="q-and-a">		
		<h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">Can we enroll a student in a class without charging them?</h4>
        
		<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
            Yes. Add a class to their cart, and in the right margin create a 100% manual discount.  This will zero out their cart balance and allow you to submit the $0 transaction as "Cash".</div>

        Yes. ClassBug offers a best-in-class <span class="autopay">AutoPay</span> feature, which gives your customers the option to pay larger tuition bills in installments based on the rules you set up .<br><br>
        ClassBug autopay is fully automated, meaning once a plan is added to a customer's purchase, the payments are taken automatically.  No processing or manual auditing on your end.  ClassBug even contacts customers on your behalf when their payment is overdue.<br><br>
  
            Like most features, we built AutoPay to be setup as simply as possible. Most users have AutoPay ready to go in 2 minutes. Click on "Storefront" to get started.<br><br>
    
    You should see 3 different options:
<ul>
	<li>Standard Schedule <span class="text-muted">Charges customers once/month on the 15th day from the time they purchase.</span></li>
	<li>Delayed Start Date <span class="text-muted">Charges customers once/month on the 15th.  First payment is taken upon purchase, but monthly payments don't begin until month specified.</span></li>
	<li>Custom Schedule<span class="text-muted">Business decides exactly what dates payments occur and % of bill will be taken on each date.  Must be updated once a month to ensure dates haven't passed.</span></li>

        Reg fees in Classbug are per student, and are automatically added to a cart when an eligible class or classes is selected.  You can make any class eligible for a registration fee
        when you setup sales option for that class (just make sure the registration fee has already been created).<br><br>

			If the class is available for sale at your web store, the option to buy will be replaced with an "add to waitlist" option.  This happens by default, but can be customized as part of a store customization package (free for paid users).
			<br><br>
			If you're in POS and attempt to add a student to a full class, the software will prompt you, allowing you to override the capacity and add the student anyway, add to waitlist, or cancel the transaction.
			<br><br>
                You can see/edit your waiting lists any time by going to "Storefront", and clicking "Waiting Lists".

		<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
            Registered students are those people associated with a "Head of Family" profile in the software.  For families, the Head of Family is the main purchaser.  For individuals, the "Head of Family" profile acts as their main ClassBug user account, with access to login info, passwords, CC number.</div>

<div class="q-and-a">		
		<h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">Why do the Heads of Family also have a student profile?</h4>
        
		<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
            For flexibility and organization.  If you ever wanted to offer an adult class, your family head would also be enrolling.  By giving all family heads their own student profile by default, the software doesn't have to handle unnecessary segregation of data, and thus works more efficiently.</div>

		<h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">Why are my classes layered in the schedule?</h4>
    
		<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
			Classes are layered to give you a visual snapshot of everything that's going on at your studio at the proper times.  Other schedulers out there tend to list classes above and below each other, even if those classes run at the same time,
                which gives an inaccurate visual of what's happening at the venue.<br><br>
                For best viewing of the schedule, utilize the calendar filters by clicking the "filters" button at the top right corner.  Also check out the month, week, and single-day views.

		<h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">What is the quick-add "+" button for next to the date?</h4>
    
		<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
            This is used to quickly add a one-time class or event for any given day.  EG, this can be used to add private lessons as they get scheduled without having to fill out the entire "Add Class/Event" form.
		</div>

<div class="q-and-a">		
		<h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">In the class popup, I see there are boxes on both the left side and right side of each name on my roster.  What are they for?</h4>
    
		<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
            The box on the left is simply a check box for attendance: if you check the box, that student is present, and the software remembers in real-time which boxes have been checked.  
			<br><br>
            The box on the right is a color selector.  It's up to you what you want the colors to mean, if anything.  Some common uses for the colors include:
			<ul style="list-style: disc">
				<li>Tracking payments (EG green for paid-in-full, red for delinquent)</li>
				<li>Tracking attendance quality (EG blue for late, red for unexcused absence, green for excused absence)</li>
				
			</ul>
			
            You can view the entire attendance sheet -- with all your checked boxes and colors -- under "Reports", "Attendance Sheets".

		<div class="faq-answer click-reveal target collapsed">
