    <h3 id="overview">What is Senior Space (tm)?</h3>
Simply put, Senior Space is  management software for senior centers. It is a tool that helps streamline and automate most admin tasks at a Senior Center, and includes some very powerful member management features that help you track member transactions, activity and other data.
The Senior Space software is a bundle of three different platforms that all work together:
        
       <ul>
            
           <li>a) Your management portal: This is what center managers and employees use to schedule classes and events, manage member data, manage instructor & volunteer schedules, process payments and generate reports (and more!).</li>
           <li>b) The Kiosk: The kiosk is for members of the center to use. Primarily, they will use the kiosk to check-in to classes & events. The kiosk can also be used as an info center to provide important information to members daily.</li>
           <li>c) Your Member portal: This is a web-based portal for your members to use via their personal computer, tablet, smartphone or other device with internet. Via the member portal, members can access schedules, purchase memberships/events/retail items, and update their profile data and much more.</li>
            
       </ul>

<div class="q-and-a">
    
    <h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">I'm a manager at the Senior Center, how do I access the management portal?</h4>
    
    <div class="click-reveal target collapsed">If you were the one who set up your center account in Senior Space, you are considered the first admin user and should already have a login to the management portal. To login, just visit ourseniorspace.com and enter your email and password. If you’re not the one who set things up, you will need a current admin user to invite you via the software. To invite someone to the management portal, just login to Senior Space at ourseniorcenter.com, click "Dashboard", and under "Your Team", click "manage" and "Invite new user". Enter their email and send the invite!

<div class="q-and-a">

    <h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">Does everyone at the center have the same level of access to the system?</h4>
    
<div class="click-reveal target collapsed">No. You can adjust anyone's level of access. There are 3 tiers of access you can assign to your team members. 
    <ul>
        <li>1) Admin: sees everything </li>
        <li>2) Non-admin: sees everything except sensitive financial data</li>
        <li>3) Instructor: can manage scheduling and member data, but nothing else</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

</div>
        

<div class="q-and-a">
    <h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">How does the system know what memberships we offer?</h4>
    
    <div class="click-reveal target collapsed">You'll need to set those up. Just click "Add New Membership Offering" on your dashboard. Fill out the form to create a new membership offering. You have several different options depending on how you prefer to handle memberships at your center.
    <br>
    <br>
</div>

<div class="q-and-a">
    <h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">How can I add our classes & events to the system?</h4>
    
<div class="click-reveal target collapsed">It's easy! Just go to your Schedule tab and click the "Add new class/event" button in the top corner. You will be asked to fill out a quick form with all pertinent class info. 
If you will be adding many classes at once, it's a good idea to use the "Create Similar" feature once your first class has been created.

<div class="q-and-a">

    <h4 data-click-reveal=".faq-answer" class="click-reveal source collapsed">Our memberships include access to most classes/events at no charge, but we do offer some classes/events that require a fee. How can I set those up in Senior Space?</h4>
    
 <div class="click-reveal target collapsed">- There are a couple of things to consider here:
     <ul>
         <li>1) For all classes/events that are included in a membership, please make sure those classes/events are associated with the membership in the system. You can associate any class with a membership when you first create the classes, or later by accessing the Membership Offering itself (Dashboard >> Membership Offerings >> edit).</li>

         <li>2) For a class/event that requires a fee, you'll need to setup sales options for that class/event. To do this, go to Schedule, click on the class, then click "Sell this class with SS". There are several different options on the next page depending on how you'd like to sell the class/event.</li>
     </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>1) Click POS tab at the top</li>
            <li>2) If the purchaser is already in the system, begin typing their name under "Existing member/customer". If they are not in the system, you'll need to click "New Member/Customer", then fill out the person's info. Once their profile is created, click "Go to POS" to begin the transaction</li>
            <li>3) Add items to the customer’s cart, choose a payment type and complete purchase when ready.</li>
